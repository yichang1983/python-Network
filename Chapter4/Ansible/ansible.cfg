# Since Ansible 2.12 (core):
# To generate an example config file (a "disabled" one with all default settings, commented out):
#               $ ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
#
# Also you can now have a more complete file by including existing plugins:
# ansible-config init --disabled -t all > ansible.cfg

# For previous versions of Ansible you can check for examples in the 'stable' branches of each version
# Note that this file was always incomplete  and lagging changes to configuration settings

# for example, for 2.9: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/examples/ansible.cfg

#[persistent_connection]
#ssh_type = libssh


[defaults]
transport = paramiko
hostfile = ./hosts
host_key_checking = False
interpreter_python=auto
timeout = 5
stdout_callback = debug     
#stdout_callback = debug,可将输出变得人性化；默认输出会挤在一行，配置后会换行输出；
